For Agentic development:


I have pulled a demo AGENTS.md from https://github.com/gothinkster/golang-gin-realworld-example-app/blob/main/AGENTS.md
and plan to modify that to fit my needs

I also plan to roughly follow the guidelines found here:
https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks

and maybe also include the ones detailed here:
https://www.zachdaniel.dev/p/my-llm-workflow-and-tools-june-06

I am trying to figure out how all of these different things combine together and achieve a production ready application


I also want to look into skills as well.
